# Suphakit's Home

This is another Homepage remaking (again) to trying new library.
This time I used [Solid.JS](https://www.solidjs.com/) with [Tailwind.CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to make this Homepage :)

## Usage

Before start using this. Don't forget to install dependency by using

```bash
npm install # or `pnpm install` or `yarn`
```

After installing dependency just and just want to [preview](#preview) / [development](#development) just go to next section

### Development

To start development just start with

```bash
npm run dev # or `pnpm dev` or `yarn dev`
```

### Preview

To start Previewing just start with

```bash
npm run start # or `pnpm run start` or `yarn start`
```
